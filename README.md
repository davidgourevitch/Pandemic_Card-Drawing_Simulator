# Pandemic_AI_AKA_Deep_Black

## Purpose
To create an AI capable of making the statistically best plays in a game of pandemic.

## Backstory
I am the Canadian national champion in Pandemic for 2017 and have been invited to compete
and defend my title this year as well. This project initially began simply as a card-drawing 
simulator for when I didn't have the expansions with me. It then evolved into me making an 
algorithm to analyse the optimal plays in a random game of pandemic. Now, it is something 
else entirely...
